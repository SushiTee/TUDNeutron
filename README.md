# TUDNeutron

This project contains tow different measurement systems using the Zedboard [1].

* SimpleNeutron
* ADCNeutron

*SimpleNeutron* is to count and measure the time between impulses. The impulses are digital signals

*ADCNeutron* uses the ADC extension board DC1884A-F from Linear Technology [2] to measure analog data.

Both systems are used on the training reactor AKR-2 of TU-Dresden.

For more information about the parts and on how to build the software browse the subdirectories.
